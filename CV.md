## Achievements in TDCX's Project 305

### Level up the standard of team

Team's knowledge
* Within a year at TDCX's project 305, I was assigned by my team leader to frontier to tackle the team's toughest problems where no one before could solve; While most avoid the difficult and rare problems that were brought up by customers, I went to the uncharted territory. After trying, researching, testing, and then solving the problem, I then documented my findings and experience, to allow my team members to gain the insight on how to solve problems that were never seen in team before.

Standard of team
* Within a year, I have introduced my team to new tool, technology, and workflow to greatly improve the team's standard and the quality of written software code. My team and colleagues went from surgeons who perform operations with a kitchen knife to surgeons who use a quality scalpel.

### Improve Standard Operating Procedure

Set a good example
* New way of scoring employee's competency was introduced in 2023, by categorising tier into [ Gold, Silver, Bronze ] Highest to lowest quality demand respectively. My working style and performance have been elected by management to be the new good example on how to handle tasks effectively in the Gold and Silver level tier. As a result, new KPI metrics were introduced along new Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to employees who are eligible for Gold and Silver tier.

Co-author SOPs
* Assisted client to maintain and introduce new Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and guidelines; I assisted clients to patch more than 15+ SOPs and I am author 1 new SOP.


### Expansion of team

Increased team's size
* Help team to steadily increased team size from 15 core employees to ~50 employees over the years in 2022 to 2024
* Assisted company to onboard 20+ new joiner and train more than 50 employees

Guidelines and documents
* Written more than 10 quality documents with dozens of guidelines to prevent and solve the previously undocumented problems.
* Produce more than 4 new custom training materials to assist on upskilling employees.
